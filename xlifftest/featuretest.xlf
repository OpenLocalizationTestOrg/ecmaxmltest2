        <source>Learning is more powerful and dynamic with tools that are already right in front of you – and it’s up to educators to impress this on students in the classroom. 

With Microsoft OneNote, educators can create digital notebooks that support academic standards and education outcomes across disciplines and tasks, such as writing, reading, mathematics, science, history, CTE, and elective courses. Students may use OneNote across content areas and grade levels, and use OneNote to compile and organize unstructured information, research, and content. OneNote also supports research, collaboration, information management, communication, note taking, journaling, reflective writing, and academic requirements.</source>

All of those notes are automatically saved in OneNote, so there's no need to keep track of a physical piece of paper. Your notes are always there, from any device, in any location.</pc>
          <pc id="1" htmlTag="p">The Draw tab has many options for different types of writing utensils: pens, pencils, and even glitter pens. You can choose the thickness and colors by selecting the down arrow next to each choice. There is an erase button, because everyone makes mistakes. But there is also another way to backtrack without having to erase. In the upper right quadrant, there are two arrows. The one of the left allows you to go backward in time, retracing what was most recently put on the page. The other arrow allows you move forward again. This allows teachers to see exactly what is happening in a student's thought process and they can easily identify where a breakdown in thought may have occurred. For an even faster overview, teachers can select some content, touch the 
            <pc id="1" htmlTag="strong">Replay</pc> button (in the View tab) and a small video from start to finish of that section will play. Don't we all wish we could rewind or fast forward once in a while?!
